title: "Structure Of Backend Application"
date: "2022-06-08"

Before we move into the topic of testing, we will modify the structure of our project to adhere to Node.js best practices.

After making the changes to the directory structure of our project, we end up with the following structure:

```
├── index.js
├── app.js
├── build
│   └── ...
├── controllers
│   └── notes.js
├── models
│   └── note.js
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── utils
│   ├── config.js
│   ├── logger.js
│   └── middleware.js
```

So far we have been using console.log and console.error to print different information from the code. However, this is not a very good way to do things. Let's separate all printing to the console to its own module utils/logger.js:

```
const info = (...params) => {
  console.log(...params)
}

const error = (...params) => {
  console.error(...params)
}

module.exports = {
  info, error
}
```

Extracting logging into its own module is a good idea in more ways than one. If we wanted to start writing logs to a file or send them to an external logging service like graylog or papertrail we would only have to make changes in one place.

The contents of the index.js file used for starting the application gets simplified as follows:

```
const app = require('./app') // the actual Express application
const http = require('http')
const config = require('./utils/config')
const logger = require('./utils/logger')

const server = http.createServer(app)

server.listen(config.PORT, () => {
  logger.info(`Server running on port ${config.PORT}`)
})
```

The index.js file only imports the actual application from the app.js file and then starts the application. The function info of the logger-module is used for the console printout telling that the application is running.

The handling of environment variables is extracted into a separate utils/config.js file:

```
require('dotenv').config()

const PORT = process.env.PORT
const MONGODB_URI = process.env.MONGODB_URI

module.exports = {
  MONGODB_URI,
  PORT
}
```

The other parts of the application can access the environment variables by importing the configuration module:

```
const config = require('./utils/config')

logger.info(`Server running on port ${config.PORT}`)
```

The route handlers have also been moved into a dedicated module. The event handlers of routes are commonly referred to as controllers, and for this reason we have created a new controllers directory. All of the routes related to notes are now in the notes.js module under the controllers directory.

The contents of the notes.js module are the following:

```
const notesRouter = require('express').Router()
const Note = require('../models/note')

notesRouter.get('/', (request, response) => {
  Note.find({}).then(notes => {
    response.json(notes)
  })
})

notesRouter.get('/:id', (request, response, next) => {
  Note.findById(request.params.id)
    .then(note => {
      if (note) {
        response.json(note)
      } else {
        response.status(404).end()
      }
    })
    .catch(error => next(error))
})

notesRouter.post('/', (request, response, next) => {
  const body = request.body

  const note = new Note({
    content: body.content,
    important: body.important || false,
    date: new Date()
  })

  note.save()
    .then(savedNote => {
      response.json(savedNote)
    })
    .catch(error => next(error))
})

notesRouter.delete('/:id', (request, response, next) => {
  Note.findByIdAndRemove(request.params.id)
    .then(() => {
      response.status(204).end()
    })
    .catch(error => next(error))
})

notesRouter.put('/:id', (request, response, next) => {
  const body = request.body

  const note = {
    content: body.content,
    important: body.important,
  }

  Note.findByIdAndUpdate(request.params.id, note, { new: true })
    .then(updatedNote => {
      response.json(updatedNote)
    })
    .catch(error => next(error))
})

module.exports = notesRouter
```

However, there are a few significant changes. At the very beginning of the file we create a new router object:

```
const notesRouter = require('express').Router()

//...

module.exports = notesRouter
```

All routes are now defined for the router object, in a similar fashion to what we had previously done with the object representing the entire application.

It's worth noting that the paths in the route handlers have shortened. In the previous version, we had:

```
app.delete('/api/notes/:id', (request, response) => {
```

And in the current version, we have:

```
notesRouter.delete('/:id', (request, response) => {
```

A router object is an isolated instance of middleware and routes. You can think of it as a “mini-application,” capable only of performing middleware and routing functions. Every Express application has a built-in app router.

The router is in fact a middleware, that can be used for defining "related routes" in a single place, that is typically placed in its own module.

The app.js file that creates the actual application, takes the router into use as shown below:

```
const notesRouter = require('./controllers/notes')
app.use('/api/notes', notesRouter)
```

After making these changes, our app.js file looks like this:

```
const config = require('./utils/config')
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const cors = require('cors')
const notesRouter = require('./controllers/notes')
const middleware = require('./utils/middleware')
const logger = require('./utils/logger')
const mongoose = require('mongoose')

logger.info('connecting to', config.MONGODB_URI)

mongoose.connect(config.MONGODB_URI)
  .then(() => {
    logger.info('connected to MongoDB')
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    logger.error('error connecting to MongoDB:', error.message)
  })

app.use(cors())
app.use(express.static('build'))
app.use(express.json())
app.use(middleware.requestLogger)

app.use('/api/notes', notesRouter)

app.use(middleware.unknownEndpoint)
app.use(middleware.errorHandler)

module.exports = app
```

The file takes different middleware into use, and one of these is the notesRouter that is attached to the /api/notes route.

Our custom middleware has been moved to a new utils/middleware.js module:

```
const logger = require('./logger')

const requestLogger = (request, response, next) => {
  logger.info('Method:', request.method)
  logger.info('Path:  ', request.path)
  logger.info('Body:  ', request.body)
  logger.info('---')
  next()
}

const unknownEndpoint = (request, response) => {
  response.status(404).send({ error: 'unknown endpoint' })
}

const errorHandler = (error, request, response, next) => {
  logger.error(error.message)

  if (error.name === 'CastError') {
    return response.status(400).send({ error: 'malformatted id' })
  } else if (error.name === 'ValidationError') {
    return response.status(400).json({ error: error.message })
  }

  next(error)
}

module.exports = {
  requestLogger,
  unknownEndpoint,
  errorHandler
}
```

The responsibility of establishing the connection to the database has been given to the app.js module. The note.js file under the models directory only defines the Mongoose schema for notes.

```
const mongoose = require('mongoose')

const noteSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  content: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    minlength: 5
  },
  date: {
    type: Date,
    required: true,
  },
  important: Boolean,
})

noteSchema.set('toJSON', {
  transform: (document, returnedObject) => {
    returnedObject.id = returnedObject._id.toString()
    delete returnedObject._id
    delete returnedObject.__v
  }
})

module.exports = mongoose.model('Note', noteSchema)
```

To recap, the directory structure looks like this after the changes have been made:

```
├── index.js
├── app.js
├── build
│   └── ...
├── controllers
│   └── notes.js
├── models
│   └── note.js
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── utils
│   ├── config.js
│   ├── logger.js
│   └── middleware.js
```

For smaller applications the structure does not matter that much. Once the application starts to grow in size, you are going to have to establish some kind of structure, and separate the different responsibilities of the application into separate modules. This will make developing the application much easier.

## Testing Node Applications

We have completely neglected one essential area of software development, and that is automated testing.

Let's start our testing journey by looking at unit tests. The logic of our application is so simple, that there is not much that makes sense to test with unit tests. Let's create a new file utils/for_testing.js and write a couple of simple functions that we can use for test writing practice:

```
const palindrome = (string) => {
  return string
    .split('')
    .reverse()
    .join('')
}

const average = (array) => {
  const reducer = (sum, item) => {
    return sum + item
  }

  return array.reduce(reducer, 0) / array.length
}

module.exports = {
  palindrome,
  average,
}
```

Jest is a natural choice for this course, as it works well for testing backends, and it shines when it comes to testing React applications.

Since tests are only executed during the development of our application, we will install jest as a development dependency with the command:

```
npm install --save-dev jest
```

Let's define the npm script test to execute tests with Jest and to report about the test execution with the verbose style:

```
{
  //...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "dev": "nodemon index.js",
    "build:ui": "rm -rf build && cd ../../../2/luento/notes && npm run build && cp -r build ../../../3/luento/notes-backend",
    "deploy": "git push heroku master",
    "deploy:full": "npm run build:ui && git add . && git commit -m uibuild && git push && npm run deploy",
    "logs:prod": "heroku logs --tail",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "test": "jest --verbose"  },
  //...
}
```

Jest requires one to specify that the execution environment is Node. This can be done by adding the following to the end of package.json:

```
{
 //...
 "jest": {
   "testEnvironment": "node"
 }
}
```

Let's create a separate directory for our tests called tests and create a new file called palindrome.test.js with the following contents:

```
const palindrome = require('../utils/for_testing').palindrome

test('palindrome of a', () => {
  const result = palindrome('a')

  expect(result).toBe('a')
})

test('palindrome of react', () => {
  const result = palindrome('react')

  expect(result).toBe('tcaer')
})

test('palindrome of releveler', () => {
  const result = palindrome('releveler')

  expect(result).toBe('releveler')
})
```

The ESLint configuration we added to the project in the previous part complains about the test and expect commands in our test file, since the configuration does not allow globals. Let's get rid of the complaints by adding "jest": true to the env property in the .eslintrc.js file.

```
module.exports = {
  'env': {
    'commonjs': true,
    'es2021': true,
    'node': true,
    'jest': true,  },
  'extends': 'eslint:recommended',
  'parserOptions': {
    'ecmaVersion': 12
  },
  "rules": {
    // ...
  },
}
```

In the first row, the test file imports the function to be tested and assigns it to a variable called palindrome:

```
const palindrome = require('../utils/for_testing').palindrome
```

Jest expects by default that the names of test files contain .test. In this course, we will follow the convention of naming our tests files with the extension .test.js.

Let's add a few tests for the average function, into a new file tests/average.test.js.

```
const average = require('../utils/for_testing').average

describe('average', () => {
  test('of one value is the value itself', () => {
    expect(average([1])).toBe(1)
  })

  test('of many is calculated right', () => {
    expect(average([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])).toBe(3.5)
  })

  test('of empty array is zero', () => {
    expect(average([])).toBe(0)
  })
})
```

The test reveals that the function does not work correctly with an empty array (this is because in JavaScript dividing by zero results in NaN):

There are a few things to notice about the tests that we just wrote. We defined a describe block around the tests that was given the name average:

```
describe('average', () => {
  // tests
})
```

Describe blocks can be used for grouping tests into logical collections. The test output of Jest also uses the name of the describe block:

Another thing to notice is that we wrote the tests in quite a compact way, without assigning the output of the function being tested to a variable:

```
test('of empty array is zero', () => {
  expect(average([])).toBe(0)
})
```
